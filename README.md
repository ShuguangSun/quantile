quantile
======

Agnostic (re)implementations (R/SAS/Python/C) of common quantile estimation algorithms.
---

**About**

This source code material is intended to support the claim made in [Grazzini and Lamarche's article](#References) on the need for robust, software/language-agnostic statistical processes in the development and deployment of statistical production chains. 

As a simple illustration, we implement the same identical algorithms for quantile estimation (9 derived from Hyndman and Fan's framework, plus 1 described in Cunnane's article) on different software platforms and/or using programming languages. For that purpose, we either extend (wrap) already existing implementations, or actually reimplement the algorithm from scratch.

**Description/Algorithm**

Nine quantile algorithms are made available, as discussed in Hyndman and Fan's article (see [references](#References)):

| `type` |                    description                                
|:------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------
|    1   | inverted empirical CDF                           			 
|    2   | inverted empirical CDF with averaging at discontinuities             
|    3   | observation numberer closest to qN (piecewise linear function) 
|    4   | linear interpolation of the empirical CDF                     
|    5   | Hazen's model (piecewise linear function)                     
|    6   | Weibull quantile                                             
|    7   | interpolation points divide sample range into n-1 intervals
|    8   | unbiased median (regardless of the distribution)             
|    9   | approximate unbiased estimate for a normal distribution  
|   10   | Cunnane's definition (approximately unbiased)

All sample quantiles are defined as weighted averages of consecutive order statistics. Sample 
quantiles of type `i` are defined for `1 <= i <= 9` by:

	Q[i](p) = (1 - gamma) * x[j] + gamma *  x[j+1]
where `x[j]`, for `(j-m)/N<=p<(j-m+1)/N`, is the `j`-th order statistic, `N` is the sample 
size, the value of `gamma` is a function of:

	j = floor(N*p + m)
	g = N*p + m - j
and `m` is a constant determined by the sample quantile type. 

For types 1, 2 and 3, `Q[i](p)` is a discontinuous function:

| `type` |   `p[k]`    |   `m`  |`alphap`|`betap`|	            `gamma`               | 
|:------:|:-------------:|:-------:|:------:|:-----:|:------------------------------------:|
|    1   |     `k/N`     |    0    |    0   |   0   | 1 if `g>0`, 0 if `g=0`               |
|    2   |     `k/N`     |    0    |    .   |   .   | 1/2 if `g>0`, 0 if `g=0`             | 
|    3   |  `(k+1/2)/N`  |  -1/2   |   1/2  |   0   | 0 if `g=0` and `j` even, 1 otherwise | 

For types 4 through 10, `Q[i](p)` is a continuous function of `p`, with `gamma` and `m` given 
below. The sample quantiles can be obtained equivalently by linear interpolation between the 
points `(p[k],x[k])` where `x[k]` is the `k`-th order statistic:

| `type` |     `p[k]`      |    `m`    |`alphap`|`betap`|`gamma`| 
|:------:|:---------------:|:---------:|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
|    4   |      `k/N`      |     0     |    0   |   0   |  `g`  | 
|    5   |   `(k-1/2)/N`   |    1/2    |   1/2  |   0   |  `g`  | 
|    6   |     `k/(N+1)`   |    `p`    |    0   |   1   |  `g`  | 
|    7   |  `(k-1)/(N-1)`  |   `1-p`   |    1   |  -1   |  `g`  | 
|    8   |`(k-1/3)/(N+1/3)`| `(1+p)3`  |   1/3  |  1/3  |  `g`  | 
|    9   |`(k-3/8)/(N+1/4)`|`(2*p+3)/8`|   3/8  |  1/4  |  `g`  | 
|   10   |`(k-1/4)/(N+1/2)`|`(2*p+1)/4`|   1/4  |  1/4  |  `g`  |

In the above tables, the `(alphap,betap)` pair is defined such that:

	p[k] = (k - alphap)/(n + 1 - alphap - betap)
