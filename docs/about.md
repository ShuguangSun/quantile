This source code material is intended as a supporting material for _Grazzini and Lamarche_â€™s article referenced [below](#References).

It implements the same identical algorithms for quantile 
estimation (9 derived from Hyndman and Fan's framework, plus 1 described in Cunnane's article) on different software platforms and/or using programming languages. For that purpose, it either extends (wraps) already existing implementations, or actually reimplements the algorithm from scratch.
